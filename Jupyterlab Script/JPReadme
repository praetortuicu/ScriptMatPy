A short description on how I will be working on the Jupyterlab project for Christian:
since code has already been written by someone else in the Notebook and because I find Jupyterlab to be a little
confusing at times, I think the best way to write and implement new functions to it would be the following:
for each game, I will write a function in my IDE of choice (that is Microsoft Visual Studio 2022 at this moment)
and I will then push each separate module to this repository. I think that way it is easiest to keep track of what I did,
if it is correct and it is easier for anyone else to check out. After testing is completed for each module, I will simply
copy-paste it into the Jupyterlab Notebook in its' respective cell. This is, in my opinion, the safest and most efficient way of both
writing the code and testing/keeping track of it without having to spend too much time on setting up Jupyterlab.

As a sidenote: I will also upload the instructions which Christian and Theresa have given me regarding how to implement variable
calculations for each game, just so everything makes sense when reading through the code.

If there is anything else I might have left out or should do differently, feel free to contact me.
